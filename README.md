In this project, I leveraged the COVID 19 dataset  used in SQL-exploration project. 

Specifically, I drew some useful information from the database storing covidDeaths, and covidVaccinations and made good use of them for building a simple dashboard capturing the highlights of COVID-19 situation across the globe from 15th February 2020 to 28th December 2021
